-- use of while loop for the check list loop
-- use of ArrayList so that the size of the array is not fixed.
-- use of equalsIgnoreCase so that if by chance capital q is used then the program will run smoothly
-- use print statements to check the smooth running of the program and check any lapses in the test cases
-- use of for(String task1 : arr).
-- use of task string input in the loop so that the program won't wait after the choice entry every time.
